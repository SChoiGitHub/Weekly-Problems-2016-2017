### Description
Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives him the possibility
to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,â€¦,n.

Example 1:

```
Would you like to compute the sum or the product? (+ for sum, x for product)
> +
What number would you like to sum to?
> 9
The sum from 1 to 9 is 45.
```

Example 2:

```
Would you like to compute the sum or the product? (+ for sum, x for product)
> x
What number would you like to compute the product to?
> 9
The product from 1 to 9 is 362880.
```

If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial
for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output)
and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).  If you check out
the README under the Weekly-Problems-2016-2017 there are many more resources
available to start learning different languages!
