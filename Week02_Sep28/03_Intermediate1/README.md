### Description
Write a program that finds the longest palindromic substring of a string given
by the user. Try to be as efficient as possible, and account for even and odd
palindromes!

```
Please provide a string? (lowercase)
> aabaabananabstewarttrawets
stewarttrawets is the longest palindrome in the given string.
```

If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output) and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).  If you check out
the README under the Weekly-Problems-2016-2017 there are many more resources
available to start learning different languages!
