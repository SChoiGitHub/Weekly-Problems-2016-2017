## Beginner 2

This will be slightly more difficult than "Beginner1", but not much.  Ask the
user for their age and respond with a friendly message that gives the difference
between your age and the users. Example:

```
How old are you?
> 20
I'm 29.  We are 9 years apart.
```

If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output) and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).  If you check out
the README under the Weekly-Problems-2016-2017 there are many more resources
available to start learning different languages!
