## Intermediate 1 - Name Valuation

Determine the value of a word.  Prompt the user for a word (all
lowercase unless you want to take it a step further).  The values of the letters
are of the form {a=1, b=2, ... , z=26}. In an unspecified message state the
user's word value.

#### Sample
```
What is the word you'd like to place a value on?
> blaine
The total value of your word is 43.
```

#### Note
For now we're keeping it somewhat on the lighter end.  We don't want to
scare lower classmen and we don't want to turn away upper classmen.  We will be open to
suggestions at the next KU Programming Club meeting on 09/14/16 following the
ACM meeting.  If you're an upperclassmen and have ideas for puzzles we're open
to any and all suggestions.  Thank you. - Blaine and Shaina

#### Furthermore
If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output) and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).  If you check out
the README under the Weekly-Problems-2016-2017 there are many more resources
available to start learning different languages!
