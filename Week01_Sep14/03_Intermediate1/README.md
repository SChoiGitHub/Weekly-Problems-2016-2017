## Intermediate 1

Ask for the user's name.  Check to see if the user's name (all lowercase)
is a palindrome and provide the reversed spelling and the results in a brief
message. Example:

```
What is your name? (lowercase)
> blaine
Your name backwards is "enialB", this is not a palindrome.
```

```
What is your name? (lowercase)
>bob
Your name backwards is "bob", this is a palindrome.
```

#### Note
We will be adding an advanced category in future weekly problems.  For now We're
keeping it to intermediate to see the responses.  We don't want to scare lower
classmen and we don't want to turn away upper classmen.  We will be open to
suggestions at the next KU Programming Club meeting on 09/14/16 following the
ACM meeting.  If you're an upperclassmen and have ideas for puzzles we're open
to any and all suggestions.  Thank you. - Blaine and Shaina 

#### Furthermore
If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output) and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).  If you check out
the README under the Weekly-Problems-2016-2017 there are many more resources
available to start learning different languages!
